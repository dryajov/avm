1. Description:
This code is written in a kernel module on Linux Centos 7.3 with kernel version as 3.10+. It will require root priviledges
to compile and run this code.
This code validates that the logic mentioned in the online test is working correctly. This code is not a final solution 
because it assumes map and queue sizes and also ignore the memory freeing and other stuffs.

Main functionality of deep copy  starts from function ch_tree_main() defined in tree_deep_copy.c

There are 5 files created for deep copy functionality:

1. README   : Basic details
2. Makefile : To compile the code
3. tree_deep_copy.h  : Source Header file
4. tree_deep_copy.c  : Source code for Deep Copy
5. tree_deep_utils.c : Utility functions for memory/map/queue allocation/deallocations and module loading/unloading functions


2. How to compile the code
#> make all

3. How to run.
#> make ins
The above command will load a kernel module in kernel. Please dont' use a production machine to run this code because it is not
freeing memory currently. Instead use a test virtual machine and execute this code there.

3. How to rerun.
#> make rm ins
The above command will unload the previously loaded module and load a new one

4. How to view the output
Run the following command at shell command prompt. 
#> dmesg |grep DeepCopy

e.g. 
#> dmesg --clear ; make rm ins ; dmesg |grep DeepCopy
